# Synthetic Experiments

Main code is <code>gma.py</code> which produces the synthetic scale recovery results in the paper.

Look at <code>gma_noise.py</code> for updating noise along with beta in the optimization.

Look at <code>gma_wishart.py</code> for predictive synthetic experiments using a wishart distribution.
